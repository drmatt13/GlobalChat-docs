          This project aims to accurately depict what an enterprise development
          project with an emphasis on serverless technology could look like.
          Although any arbitrary corporate development project will possess its
          own unique aspects, a consistent priority for project leadership,
          regardless of the team or project you find yourself a part of, should
          be to optimize resources efficiently with the goal of maximum
          productivity while navigating constraints such as budget, time,
          talent, and overall project complexity. No organization operates under
          perfect conditions when bringing a new product to market, but
          successful project management requires adaptability, resourcefulness,
          expertise, and strategic thinking. For this project, we will assume
          the role of an enterprise-level organization set to develop and
          implement the high-level architecture showcased in the previous
          section. The methodologies and strategies we use to design, develop,
          and maintain this theoretical architecture are directly applicable to
          real-life software development. This approach demonstrates a
          comprehensive understanding of the processes and best practices
          necessary for successful enterprise-level projects. The project team
          hierarchy for this new initiative will be structured in the following
          format:
